python-bittrex
==============

These are Python bindings for the official Bittrex API.

**Note: I am not associated with Bitttrex and this is an _unofficial_ API wrapper.**

Use at your own risk.

### Installation

To install, use `pip` with `setuptools` installed: `pip install bittrex`.

Alternatively, you can clone the GitHub repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/panchr/python-bittrex.git
cd python-bittrex
python setup.py install
```

Or, as a single line that you can copy to install: `git clone https://github.com/panchr/python-bittrex.git && cd python-bittrex && python setup.py install`.

### Testing

In order to run the integration tests, a file called "secrets.json" must be added to the test folder.
Structure it as follows, adding your API keys:
```
{
  "key": "mykey",
  "secret": "mysecret"
}
```

As an alternative, you can pass BitTrex credentials using these environment
variables:
* BITTREX_API_KEY
* BITTREX_API_SECRET
